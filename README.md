# UCLA Online Planner

## Synopsis

*UCLA Online Planner* is a personal side project in development that creates a
student planner as a Web application. The design of the planner is adopted from
that of the student planner given to incoming UCLA freshmen at New Student
Orientation and sold at the
<a href="http://shop.uclastore.com/">UCLA Store</a>. The current planner can be
viewed <a href="http://uclastudentplanner.apphb.com/login.aspx">here</a>.

accounts. If you wish to see the current functionality of the planner, please
